# Includes

## Description

Can you get the flag?\
Go to this [website](http://saturn.picoctf.net:50761/) and see what you can discover.

## Hints

- Hint 1: Is there more code than what the inspector initially shows?

## Solution

First of all, I open the website and see what it is. There is a button that says "Say hello" and when I click it, it says "This code is in a separate file!".

Then I immediately look for the script tag and found that there is a file called `script.js`. I open it, this is the code:

```javascript
function greetings() {
  alert("This code is in a separate file!");
}

//  f7w_2of2_df589022}
```

I notice that the first part of the flag is missing, so I look for it in another file. I found a css file called `style.css` and this is the code:

```css
body {
  background-color: lightblue;
}

/*  picoCTF{1nclu51v17y_1of2_  */
```

Now the flag is complete.

## Flag

picoCTF{1nclu51v17y_1of2_f7w_2of2_df589022}
