## Description

The factory is hiding things from all of its users. Can you login as Joe and find what they've been looking at? `https://jupiter.challenges.picoctf.org/problem/13594/` ([link](https://jupiter.challenges.picoctf.org/problem/13594/)) or http://jupiter.challenges.picoctf.org:13594

## Hints

- Hint 1: Hmm it doesn't seem to check anyone's password, except for Joe's?

## Solution

The website is a simple login page. The hint suggests that we should try to login as **Joe**. I tried to login as `Joe` with `Joe` as the password and it says "**I'm sorry Joe's password is super secure. You're not getting in that way.**". Then I tried to login as `joe` (with lowercase `j`) with `joe` as the password.

The website redirected me to `/flag` page and says "**Success: You logged in! Not sure you'll be able to see the flag though.**" Then I checked the cookies and found that there is a cookie named `admin` with value `False`. I changed the value to `True` and refreshed the page. The flag is shown.

Turns out that the website checks the value of `admin` cookie to determine whether to show the flag or not and the username and password are not checked at all (except for Joe's).
